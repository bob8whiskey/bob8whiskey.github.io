Casks. I'd like to learn more about casks. I know they play a significant part in the aging process and impart flavors over the years. I see reviewers comment about how "ah, this might have spent a couple years too long in oak" and there must be notes folks can spot. Sherry as a category is pretty easy to spot because of the sweetness but I'm sure there's more subtle variations. Fun stuff to explore in the future.

For now, here are some casks I've seen listed on my bottles:

* Oak
* The *finest* oak
* American oak
* American white oak
* European oak
* Whisky
* Bourbon
* Sherry
* Spanish Oloroso sherry
* Pedro Ximenez sherry
* Sherry seasoned American
* Port
* Sauternes

I'd like to dig into the various sherry casks and sample some varieties of sherry to get a better appreciation. Also, I'd like to chew on some oak...

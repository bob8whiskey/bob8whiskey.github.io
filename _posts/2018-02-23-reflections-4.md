What to try next? That's the question... I feel like I need to do some lighter grazing around some different worldly styles to be able to get some perspective before going back to the deep dives. I think I'll spend about a week trying some different things I've stocked up and then dive back into the Kildalton Islays and the Speysides and conclude those sections with some "official" reviews.

When thinking about trying all these different styles, I'm really trying to keep an open mind. I want to approach each style on its terms and try to appreciate each one for what it brings. I'm really enjoying just about everything so far aside from the boring Glens. I almost feel as if I should be more critical but I should just accept that's not my style. It's a great problem to have if I like everything.

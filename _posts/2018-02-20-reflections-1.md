I'm heading out to visit family for the rest of the week and it seems like a good time to take a drinking break and reflect on the first month of this experiment. I'm planning on a couple cocktails on date nights but otherwise will be taking this time off. Let's kick this off with some reflections.

### Finding my way

I started this year off with a vague idea to drink a lot of whisky and write about it. It took me a few weeks to figure out that a blog would be a fun platform. I bought a few bottles of a few different varieties and started reading about whisky online. I determined different distillers and expressions to try out. I ended up with a huge list of things to try out but not a great game plan on how to taste everything.

### Biggest Regret

My biggest regret is picking up the Lagavulin Distiller's Edition. I bought it after walking into a liquor store far from home with a desire to splurge and get something I couldn't find at home. My description to find something like the Ardbeg Uigeadail but more complex led to the Distiller's. While it's delicious, it's similar to the standard Lagavulin 16 and was very expensive. On top of that, I ended up paying $20 more for the bottle than I could get it at home. Whoops!

You have to make some mistakes along the way and this one helped clarify that I'm most interested in tasting a variety of expressions. From here out, unless I can find a great deal, I'm more focused on standard expressions offered by different distilleries. I figure I can get more flavors along the way and save the fancier expressions for Year 2.

This also highlighted the need for a better plan - know what I want to try and know how much I am willing to spend. I want to try main expressions from the main distillers all over the world and I did some research on average bottle prices around my area.

### Samplers

I found a great way to try out different expressions is through samplers. The problem is that samplers can be hard to find but I lucked into a few stores with a broad selection. At least at this stage, whisky to me is for drinking and not collecting but I now have a huge inventory of samples because I'm not sure when I'll be able to pick all the different types up again. This gives me some flexibility in interesting side by side comparisons to try later. So far, I haven't found a sampler to say no to yet. I figure there's a fun bottom barrel sampler week in my future.

### First Love

I've gone on and on about Lagavulin 16. Islay has much else to offer and I want to try out the standard expressions from all 8 Islay distilleries this year. It will serve as a nice point of comparison and also a standard flavor profile I can revisit to compare all others to. Plus, big and peaty is my favorite profile so why not drink a lot of it!

More reflections tomorrow. Whisky Bob signing off.

I completed a big task at work today. As the end was near, I experienced a craving for something smokey and sweet. Good thing I had 10 mL or so from my 50 mL sample bottle left over from the other day. I poured it neat in a Glencairn. My rebottling effort seemed to work as this is the same whisky I remember from the other day. It's intensely smokey and sweet. It's really tasty but I wish there were more complexity. I wonder if a full 750 mL bottle might be better? There are also other smokey whiskies with sherry finishes to be tried another day...

Whisky Bob signing off.

I picked up this bottle of Bunnahabhain 12 a few weeks back on my trip to New Hampshire. I've been saving it for a big return trip to Islay but it's Grab Bag Week so why not pop it open today.

### Bunnahabhain 12

* Islay
* 46.3% ABV
* "Natural colour un-chillfiltered"
* Paid $50 for a 750 mL bottle
* Prorated to $1.67 / 25mL

I poured a hefty 25 mL pour neat into a Glencairn. I'm first struck by how dark this is for being non-chill filtered and naturally colored. I don't have them side by side but it seems about as dark as Lagavulin 16. The unfiltered Ardbeg 10 is a ghost in comparison.

Enough. Let's do this.

* Nose: Nutty sherry sweetness is the most prominent note. Very similar to Highland Park 12. Not much peat smoke at all.
* Taste: Some alcohol burn, some sherry notes. Nuttiness.
* Finish: Some sweetness and smoke and then a big drying feeling. Warming in the chest (this is 46.3% after all). Sweet nutty notes with a little bit of peat linger for a long time. The peat isn't really smoky - more earthy.

I get subtle variations on similar notes all the way from nose through the finish. I think this is the first whisky I've tried that's seemed so seemlessly put together. It's like a more cohesive Highland Park. It's very different from the smoky Kildalton trio on the other side of Islay.

I really like this. I wish there were a bit more complexity on the finish. The 18 year old is officially on my list of drams to try.

What does the official packaging say?

On the box:

> Russet gold, this is a complex 12 year old with hidden depths. Aromatic fruity floral scents with the most subtle hints of smoke prepare the palate for sweet fruit and nuts with vanilla and caramel finale.

> * Colour: russet gold  
> * Nose: fresh and aromatic, fruity floral with hints of dried fruit and a subtle prevalence of smoke.  
> * Palate: light with fruit notes, nutty flavours with a sweetness and slight hints of vanilla and caramel.  
> * Finish: lingering, beautifully rich and full bodied.

On the bottle:

> Our 12 year old is matured in sherry, bourbon and whisky casks for a tranquil balance of soft, sweet fruit and nuts with a hint of seaside smoke. This is a malt with many layers to explore.

Bonus points for the Distiller's notes being close to my own. I'm curious to see if more complexity develops with a week or two of oxidation.

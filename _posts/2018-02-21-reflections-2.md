Rapid fire reflections today.

### Sherry!

I've really enjoyed all the sherry expressions I've tasted so far! From the smoky Uigeadail to the punchy A'bunadh to the smooth Macallan 12, I've really developed a sweet tooth. In fact, I think I most look forward to revisiting the Macallan 12 Sherry Cask when I return to Speyside.

### Feet

The Tullamore D.E.W. really sticks in my memory. It's my least favorite whiskey but somehow the most memorable. Does one grow to crave the taste of dirty feet?

### Boring

The worst crime a whisky can commit against me is to be unmemorable. Maybe the Speyside Glens will have a bit more to offer when I revisit them?

### Touring

I think I need to visit American and Japan quickly before picking up the regional deep dives. I need a bit more breadth to help the depth have better context.

### Cask Influence

I'm so impressed by reviewers that can point out the type of cask used based on the flavor profile. It's fairly obvious to me now if a whisky was aged in a wine cask (it's sweet, yo!) and I'd like to pay more attention to the casks used when sampling.

### Vocabulary

A trip to the grocery store spice section is in my near future to develop a better vocabulary.

### The Hunger

I'm a couple days removed from my last drink and I miss it. That probably means it's good to have a break.

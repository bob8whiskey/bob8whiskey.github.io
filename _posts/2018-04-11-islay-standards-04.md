Islay Standards Day 4 brings us back to the land of peat with Bowmore 12. This is the 2nd of the 3 northwest Islay distilleries around Port Charlotte/Loch Indaal for me to try. Bowmore has a reputation for fairly mild flavors. Time to find out if I like it or if I'm bored.

### Bowmore 12 years old

The run down:
* Northwest Islay - Loch Indaal
* 40% ABV ("Wha?" - ed)
* It doesn't say so likely chill-filtered and artificially colored
* Paid ~$9 for a 50mL sampler shipped from [Fine Drams](http://www.finedrams.com)
* ~$3/~15mL pour
* Corporate overlord: Beam Suntory
* [Official website](https://www.bowmore.com/whiskies/12-year-old)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Sea air and light lemon sweetness. This reminds me of some lighter Speysides or even Redbreast 12.
* **Palate**: Bright as it hits the tongue. Light citrus notes develop as I swirl with a hint of smoke.
* **Finish**: Short-medium finish. Light lemon and malt. A very small amount of smoke. Very mellow. Smoke develops a bit as this sits.

There's a very fine line between subtle complexity and boring. This is walking it. The nose is by far the most interesting part. The palate and finish are just a bit too plain. I'm getting some serious *Glen* vibes here with a touch of smoke. The smoke on the finish feels a bit out of place with the rest of the expression but adds some interest. Overall, not quite sure how to rate this but am thinking **B-/C+** range.

I also picked up samplers of the 15 and 18 year old expressions and am curious how these stack up. Finishing up northwest Islay tomorrow with Kilchoman Machir Bay.

Whisky Bob signing off.

How to enjoy whisky? 
- Get an idea of what the general consensus is on the profile

Nose has many, many receptors
Tongue has 4x receptors: salt, sweet, sour, bitter
You smell as you taste
Take notes to articlulate your experience

Old whiskies -
Get smells and tastes that are harder to pin down. Easier to find recognizable notes from newer whiskies. Leather, tobacco, mustiness can all be in older. 
Trust your own interpretations. With time and experience, you'll be able to know when to add water.
Old whiskies go right to the back of the mouth. New whiskies stay forward. Old whiskies remain with you.

Best selling blended whisky in the world. Very consistent. A bit too much caramel coloring. 

* Nose: Balance. Some peat, some maltiness, well crafted
Quite a lot of whiskies go into this blend >20. mix of malts and grain whiskies
Fruity sour
Doesn't think it benefits from water.

Old Puteney 12
Highland Park 12 - noticable sherry influence. Sweet to sour and drying. Complex for age.
Caol Ila 12 - doesn't tend to get overpriced. Largest distillery on Islay. Overlooked by conoseuers.

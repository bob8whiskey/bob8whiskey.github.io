I'm back from a short trip and excited to close out the Islay standards by revisiting the Kildalton trio. Up first is the mighty Ardbeg 10.

### Ardbeg 10

The run down:
* South Islay - Kildalton/Port Ellen
* 46% ABV
* Non chill-filtered & natural colour
* Paid ~$39 for a 750 mL as part of the $47 Ardbeg Exploration Pack in NH (Live free and drink Ardbeg or die, baby!)
* $1.30/25mL pour
* Corporate overlord: LVMH
* [Official website](https://www.ardbeg.com/en-gb/whisky/ultimate-range/ten-years-old)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Peat smoke, ash, citrus. Sea-funk underneath.
* **Palate**: Light bodied, a bit sweet and smoky in the mouth, ashy smoke builds.
* **Finish**: Long ashy smoke finish. Citrus and light sea.

This is the most complexity I've had from this expression. Not sure if it's oxidation or palate refinement but I'm getting more sea notes now. Really like this. I'll up this to **B+/A-** borderline territory. Damn good.

I'm dying to try some other expressions. I have samplers of all the standard Ardbegs to sample in a vertical in the future: An OA, Uigeadail and Corryvreckan... considering dropping some coin on Compass Box's "No Name" expression that is mostly old Ardbeg.

Back tomorrow with the Frog.

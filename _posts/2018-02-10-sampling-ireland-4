I have a number of guiding principles in undertaking this whiskey quest:

1. Gain a deeper appreciation for all styles of whisk(e)y
2. Write every day
3. Never use terminology I don't understand 
4. Learn from others and expand my terminology after my initial impression
5. Drink every day with rare exception
6. Stick to 30 - 50 mL intake every day with rare exception
7. Stick with my current drinking plan (even when I just want to drink Lagavulin)

To address point 7, yes, I really want some Lagavulin... but it's time to finish up this tiny bottle of Jameson. I'm going to drink it along with its Midlteon distillery stablemate Redbreast 12.

To address points 3 and 4, I've formed my initial impressions over the last few days. There's some common Irish something or other that links all these whiskeys together but I can't quite describe it. Fortunately, the magnificent bastards over at the Whiskey Vault tasted Redbreast 12 along with Jameson and Green Spot:

To summarize their notes:

#### Redbreast 12

* They call this the quintessential Irish whiskey
* Nose: Buttery round note that comes from the single pot still.



I'll be back tomorrow with my last 

Whiskey Bob signing off.

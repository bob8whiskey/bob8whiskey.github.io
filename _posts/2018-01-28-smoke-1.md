To kick off smoke week, we're sampling from the three southern Islay distilleries today:

| Distillery | Expression | ABV | $/25mL | $/Bottle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Laphroaig | [10 year](https://www.laphroaig.com/product/laphroaig-10-year-old/) | 43% | $1.33 | $40/750mL |
| Lagavulin | [16 year](https://www.malts.com/en-us/our-whisky-collection/lagavulin/lagavulin-16-years-old/) | 43% | $2.17 | $65/750mL |
| Ardbeg | [Uigeadail](https://www.ardbeg.com/en-US/whisky/ultimate-range/uigeadail) | 54.2% | $3 | $6/50mL |

I'd prefer to be sampling the standard Ardbeg 10 but can't justify another full peaty bottle on the shelf. I wish there were more single malts available in 50 mL samplers! Yesterday was my first exposure to the Uigeadail. The Lagavulin has long been a favorite and I've never been able to fully appreciate the Laphroaig. Alright, onto the tasting.

I'm going to speed thing up a bit and do the rest of these samplers 25 mL each day. Up today is what I believe to be bottom shelf stuff - Canadian Club and Pendleton standard expressions. I'm diving in head first and pouring these neat in Glencairns. Because I'm obviously a gentleman. As usual, just tasting today. I'll do a bit more research when I revisit later.

### J.P. Wiser's Rye

#### Facts:

* 40% ABV
* Blended Canadian whisky
* No age statement
* Paid $2.99/50mL
* $1.50/25mL pour

#### Notes:

* Nose: Alcohol with floral sweetness. A bit of spice.
* Taste: Light in the mouth. There's a decent amount of rye spice right away.
* Finish: A mix of rye spiciness and alcohol burn. Warming sensation. Light floral notes along with the spice. The burn isn't too bad and the finish is a pleasant medium length.

#### Conclusion:

Not bad! This is my favorite of the Canadians sampled so far. I get none of the "cheap whisky" taste that the Crowns gave me. This is fairly easy drinking with a decent amount of rye flavor. Let's see if it holds up when I revisit it in a few days...

### J.P. Wiser's Spiced Vanilla

I'm out of "real" Canadian whisky samplers. Time to jump into flavor country.

#### Facts:

* 40% ABV
* Blended Canadian whisky
* No age statement
* Paid $2.99/50mL
* $1.50/25mL pour

#### Notes:

* Nose: Like the standard Rye with more alcohol and artificial vanilla. Not pleasant.
* Taste: Super sweet with rye spice.
* Finish: Crazy sweet. Some rye spice. Artificial vanilla on the finish.

#### Conclusion:

Ugh. The rye and the sweetness really don't go well for my palate. This is hard to drink. I'm guessing this style is meant for mixing. Drinking it neat is not recommended.

### Spicebox Spiced Rye

This is labeled as "Canadian blended rye whisky with natural flavors and caramel color". This is definitely a flavored whisky.

#### Facts:

* 40% ABV
* Canadian spiced whisky
* Lot No. 001372
* No age statement
* Paid $0.99/50mL
* $0.50/25mL pour

#### Notes:

* Nose: Boozy cake. Vanilla, caramel, frosting.
* Taste: Sugar! I've called other whiskies sweet but none of those can compare to this. My tongue tingles after a bit of swirling.
* Finish: Extremely sweet. Vanilla and sugar. Some oakiness. Sickeningly sweet.

#### Conclusion:

Well... I do have a sweet tooth and like bold flavors... and this is certainly bold and sugary. This reminds me of the last swig of coffee where you added too much sugar and it didn't all get absorbed. It's just too sweet to drink on its own. Way too sweet. I had trouble finishing this. Each sip was harder to take down than the last.

I was curious about Mrs. Whisky's thoughts on this one:

> Nose: Kind of vanilla-y. Cinnamon. And then booze. Smells good!
> Taste: Gahh!!! Like paint thinner... and a bit of vanilla.

She didn't like it.

### Final Thoughts

I liked the rye! The Wiser's Vanilla is terrible neat. The Spicebox is simpler but I enjoyed it more. I think it's clear that neither of these flavored expressions is meant to be drank solo. They're vile. I have half a mini of each left? Ugh.

Whisky Bob signing off.

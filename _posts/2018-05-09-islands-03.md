My tour of the islands continues with Jura 12 Elixir today. It looks like Jura recently revamped its line so I'm not sure how this fits into their current offerings.

### Jura 12 Elixir

The run down:
* Isle of Jura (between the Scottish mainland and Islay)
* 46% ABV
* Looks like a decent amount of coloring has been added
* Paid $6.82 shipped for a 30 mL sample from Fine Drams
* Corporate overlord: Emperador

* **Nose:** Strong ethanol hit, some sweetness. It burns.
* **Taste:** Lots of sweet flavor, some burning. Light-medium bodied. Develops some earthiness as it swirls around my mouth.
* **Finish:** Very short. Some sweetness develops over time. Some earthiness and ethanol kick.

This comes in a bit hot and then there's not a whole lot on the finish. It's a decent dram but it doesn't do much of anything for me. **C**.

Let's see if Arran 18 brings up these middling island expressions tomorrow...

Whisky Bob signing off.

I tried a bourbon yesterday, might as well move along to a rye today. [Tons](http://www.whiskeyprof.com/rye-whiskeys-sourced-from-mgp-ingredients-in-lawrenceburg-indiana/) of ryes are sourced from [MGP in Indiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGP_of_Indiana). Bulleit is one of the best selling and I found it cheap so seems like a good place to start.

#### Facts:

* 45% ABV
* Mashbill: 95% rye, 5% malted barley
* Paid $14 for 375 mL bottle in New Hampshire
* Prorated to $0.56 for a 25 mL neat pour in a Glencairn

#### Tasting:

* Nose: Spicier than Buffalo Trace but with some sweetness. Smell both the rye and corn, if my understanding of what I'm smelling is correct.
* Taste: Dill pickles! I heard that note might be present but holy crap, it's the main thing I taste. I love pickles so this isn't a bad thing. A small amount of lingering sweetness. Very full bodied - reminds me of Redbreast in an interesting way.
* Finish: Medium length. Dill pickles!

After taking a few sips, that pickle note makes its way to the nose. The spice and complexity is probably most similar to Redbreast out of anything I've tried. Call it Redbreast with pickles.

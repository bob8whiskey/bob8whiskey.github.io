Whisky Bob only ate a banana today so this neat pour of Highland Park 12 in a Glencairn packs a punch. There's a lot of sweetness and the smokiness on the finish comes through when I chew a bit. It's like a very pleasing cigar in my mouth. Very dry finish. Despite the empty stomach, I'm able to hold the liquor in my mouth a lot easier today - hooray for dulled senses! Getting more wood notes on the nose. Some vanilla. There's a nice warming feeling. Some numbing. I enjoy this.

Whisky Bob signing off.

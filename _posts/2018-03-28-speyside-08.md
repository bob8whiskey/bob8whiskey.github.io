Alright, kids. Whisky Bob is back. I'm back in the land of the living after a nasty cold. The beginning of the week was filled with some late nights at work so I'm just now getting back to my beloved whisky. Continuing with Speysides with some informal tastings of Macallan 12 and Speyburn 10 while wrestling kids to sleep.

#### Macallan 12 - 15 mL

This is just a solid sherried whisky. Much more approachable than Aberlour A'bunadh at 43% but a very similar flavor profile. It's fairly simple but executes perfectly. A quintessential *B* rating in my book - a solid, simple dram.

#### Speyburn 10 - 15 mL

This is like Glenfiddich with a dose of earthy funk. The earthy funk reminds me of Tullamore DEW but I like it better here. There's a little peppery spice alongside a light sweetness. It's very crisp and then the earthiness. I like it... not sure how I'd rate it, though. The Macallan is just so classic. There's more going on here but it's less refined which takes it down. I'd probably balance it out to also give it a *B*.

Whisky Bob signing off.

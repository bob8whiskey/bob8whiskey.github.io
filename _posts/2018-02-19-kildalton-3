I feel like I have a pretty good handle on the Kildalton trio. Let's put that confidence to the test with a series of blind taste tests. Mrs. Whisky will pour 15 mL samples and keep track with a sophisticated color dot system. She'll switch up the dots for each test.

### Color test, wherein I look at the whisky



### Nose test, wherein I smell the whisky

### Taste test, wherin I drink the whisky

### Conclusion, wherin I think deep thoughts

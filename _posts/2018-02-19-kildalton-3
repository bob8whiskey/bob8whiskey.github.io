I feel like I have a pretty good handle on the Kildalton trio. Let's put that confidence to the test with a series of blind taste tests. Mrs. Whisky will pour 20 mL samples and keep track with a sophisticated color coded system. She'll switch up the colors for each test.

### Color test, wherein I look at the whisky

The color on the three are very different making this an easy task. The Ardbeg is non chill filtered and hasn't had any extra coloring and it's the lightest of the bunch by far. The Lagavulin is a bit darker than the Laphroaig.

**3/3**

### Nose test, wherein I smell the whisky

These were incredibly difficult to tell apart. All the peat smoke quickly blended together and overwhelmed my senses. I thought I detected a citrusy note that I attributed to the Ardbeg but it was actually the Laphroaig. Of the remaining two, one had a stronger alcohol aroma that I attributed to the Laphroaig. It was the Lagavulin. Oops.

**0/3**

### Taste test, wherin I drink the whisky

This was easier than smell alone. The ashy, dry, citrusy finish make the Ardbeg stand out. I drank it first and called it out correctly. The next one had a big peat hit a salty, seashore-like finish. Laphroaig. I sipped these too quickly and my tastebuds were shot. I sipped the Lagavulin but honestly couldn't pick it out of the lineup. Thank you, process of elimination.

**3/3**



### Nose test, part 2, wherein I let the whiskies sit for a couple hours and smell them again


### Conclusion, wherin I think deep thoughts

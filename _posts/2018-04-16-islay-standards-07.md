It's the penultimate Standard Islay Day. It's Laphroaig 10. It's good.

### Laphroiag 10

The run down:
* South Islay - Kildalton/Port Ellen
* 43% ABV
* Likely chill-filtered and E150 coloring added
* Paid ~$40 for a 750 mL bottle
* $1.33/25mL pour
* Corporate overlord: Beam Suntory
* [Official website](https://www.laphroaig.com/product/laphroaig-10-year-old/)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Peat smoke, sea, medicinal notes, some sweetness.
* **Palate**: Light bodied, smoky.
* **Finish**: Long, smoky, salty sea. Sweetness. Salt and smoke last awhile. Really nice finish.

I've grown to really like the sweet sea characteristic Laphroaig profile. I'd like a bit more of a kick than 43%, though, and need to check out the cask strength version sometime soon. I only got smoke when I first drank this so all this whisky drinking has obviously done something for my palate. I'll knock this down a tad and go **B/B+** line.

Finishing this series off tomorrow with the expression that started it all for me.

Whisky Bob signing off.

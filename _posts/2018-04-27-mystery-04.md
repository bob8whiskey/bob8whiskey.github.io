### Mystery Whisky #3

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Alcohol, sherry-like sweetness, wood. Scotch?
* **Palate**: Light-medium bodied. Gentle sweetness that grows and then some tobacco like notes.
* **Finish**: Quick finish and then some nice sweet woody notes linger awhile.

This has a Speyside like profile. There seems to a be a bit more oomph than the other two so I'll guess mid to high 40s ABV. This isn't terribly complex and the flavors that are here aren't doing a whole lot for me. It reminds me of Bunnahabhain 12 without the nuttiness or Highland Park 12 without the peat. I'd prefer a bit more kick ala A'bunadh or a bit more smoothness ala Macallan for this flavor profile. I'll give it a **C++/B-** first impression. Clearly my least favorite of the three samples... which means it's probably something super fancy :P

Back tomorrow trying all three side by side! Really curious to see what flavors are brought out when drinking these all together.

Whisky Bob signing off.

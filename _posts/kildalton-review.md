# Scotch Reviews #1-3: Lagavulin 16, Laphroaig 10, Ardbeg 10

Like many of you, I come to Scotch from the cult of Ron Swanson and Lagavulin 16. I know that legends take time. 16 years to be exact... yet somehow my mindlink to Mother Diageo was severed and I discovered a desire to experience other flavors in the wide world of whisky. So I'm off on a year of whisky exploration sampling everything from the bottom shelf to the glass case.

For my first reviews, I'll stay close to my whisky home and explore the standard expressions of the three south Islay distilleries.

## Lagavulin 16

43% ABV | chill-filtered with "fancy" coloring | paid $65/750mL metrowest Boston

* **Nose**:
* **Palate**:
* **Finish**:

This is my whisky home and it's hard to be completely unbiased. Love me some bandaids.

This is still my favorite of the three. But the more I drink, the better others

Ignoring price, how's the whisky? I'm getting more of a wine-like sweetness on the nose similar to Bunnahabhain 12 today. Medium mouth feel. Nice amount of smokiness and "band-aids" on the finish. The smokiness is lighter than the other two. The finish pushes it over the top for me. Love chewing on some band-aids! It seems the best integrated and there are so many tasty notes working together. Still my favorite.

This is the most delicate of the three. All of the wonderful subtlety is completely lost when drinking this side by side with either of the others.

## Laphroaig 10

43% ABV | chill-filtered with a little less "fancy" coloring | paid $40/750mL metrowest Boston

* **Nose**:
* **Palate**:
* **Finish**:

I first experienced Laphroaig 10 years ago and found it to be a simple "smoke monster" that paled in the shadow of the almighty Lagavulin. I completely disagree with that assessment now. The smoke is well integrated with a briny, salty-sea air and pleasant sweetness that give the signature Laphroaig flavor. My biggest knock now is that the standard 10 feels a bit watered down. I bet I would love the cask-strength version.

Laphroaig 10 sits in the middle of the road in intensity above the delicate Lagavulin and below the punchy Ardbeg. It's probably the best

**B/B+**

## Ardbeg 10

46% ABV | all natural, baby | paid $47 for the Ardbeg Exploration pack: 750mL Ardbeg 10, 50mL Uigeadail, and 50mL Corryvreckan at a [New Hampshire outlet](http://www.liquorandwineoutlets.com/products/detail/1112/arbeg_exploration_pack_10yr_50mluig_corr)

* **Nose**: More intense peat smoke, ash. Light citrus notes underneath. Not quite as medicinal as the others. Powerful and straight forward.
* **Palate**: Ashy in the back of my mouth as the whisky swirls around my tongue. Some numbing.
* **Finish**: Very long with some drying. Intense smoke and light citrus notes. Less complex than the others but very pleasant. A sip can last minutes.

The combination of smoke, citrus and ash scream Ardbeg and set this expression apart from its south Islay siblings. The raw flavor profile is my favorite of the bunch. While I love the profile, it is a bit one note. I'm about a third of the way through the bottle and have started picking out a bit more nuance so maybe my grade would improve a bit with a bit more time.

Because of its raw strength and tasty flavor profile, I've greatly enjoyed mixing this with other expressions to form some Frankenwhiskies. Ardbeg + A'bunadh is especially delightful at varying mix ratios.

**B+/A-**

## Summary

   | Lagavulin 16 | Laphroaig 10 | Ardbeg 10
- | - | - | -
**Notes** | Smoke, bandaids, complex | Smoke, salty sea, medicinal | Smoke, ash, citrus
**Grade** | A- | B/B+ | B+/A-
**Value** | OK to bad | Great | Great

These are all really tasty and offer unique characteristics. Choosing a "best" all comes down to personal preferences and I have no qualms with someone picking any of them. Despite being slightly watered down, Lagavulin gets the slight edge from me because of the standout "bandaid" note, complex finish, and my history with the expression.

But damn the pricing of the Lagavulin 16 is absurd. Californians with Costco membership seem to have it the best with $55 sales while our poor friends to the north have to suffer $100+ bottles. I honestly don't know if my $65 pricetag is worth the markup over the $40 price of the others... but then those damn bandaids suck me in...

I did a blind taste test and couldn't tell the difference between Lagavulin and Laphroaig. From a big picture, the two are more similar than distinct. A quick survey finds pricepoints of $35 - $50

## My wife's take

My wife doesn't drink whisky but she's a good sport. She offers an uninterested outsider's perspective and comedic value so I leave you with her thoughts:

> **Lagavulin 16**: I like the Laphroaig better. This is less smoky and has more of an alcohol burn. This has a lot of burn on the front end but it doesn't really last. The sting stays with me more than the taste. I don't like smoky whisky. **C-**
>
> **Laphroaig 10**: So smoky. Like licking an ash tray. Not as bad as Ardbeg. I wouldn't drink it but can see how someone would. It's not gross, I just don't like it. **C**
>
> **Ardbeg 10**: It tastes dirty. It tastes like someone tried to clean a chemical spill but they weren't successful. Chemical. Alcohol. Also dirt. It's bad. I don't like it. I just imagine there's something worse out there.**D**

There you have it.

Islay Standards Day 5 brings me to Islay's newest distillery, Kilchoman, opened in 2005. It's so new that there's no Brian Cox pronunciation video. I looked it up - it's Kil-ho-man. Their whisky range consists primarily of no age statement expressions. I picked up a couple samples from Fine Drams, the Machir Bay and Sanaig. The Machir Bay is listed as the flagship on their website so that's what I'll be drinking in this series. Unfortunately, I only have 30 mL samples of each so won't have much ability to refine my notes.

### Kilchoman Machir Bay (2014 bottling)

The run down:
* Northwest Islay - Loch Indaal
* 46% ABV
* Non chill filtered & natural colour
* Paid ~$7.16 for a 30mL sampler shipped from [Fine Drams](http://www.finedrams.com)
* ~$3.58/~15mL pour
* Corporate overlord: Independent! ("Awesome!" - ed)
* [Official website](https://kilchomandistillery.com/our-single-malt-whisky)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Sea air, some kind of sweetness. Like a less smoky Laphroaig. Butterscotch comes to mind after reading the official tasting notes.
* **Palate**: Light bodied, pleasant burning and smokiness.
* **Finish**: Sea notes, vanilla sweetness, earthiness. Again like a less smoky Laphroaig. I get more smoke with each sip.

I wrote yesterday that there's a fine line between refined and boring. Bowmore 12 fell on the wrong side of that line and Machir Bay falls on the right side of it. This is a subtle expression but it's really well balanced. The profile is very reminiscent of Laphroaig without the peat smoke kick. There's some smokiness that builds the more I sip. I had that same sensation with the Bowmore 12 and it feels very well integrated here when it felt less balanced there. I wish I had more of this to drink to get better acquainted with the expression. Solid **B/B+**.

I'm traveling the next couple of days for work and will leave them as #NoWhisky days. Back Sunday with one of the Kildalton trio as this Islay Standard adventure reaches the home stretch.

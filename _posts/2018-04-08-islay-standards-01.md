Seven Islay distilleries, each with a standard expression, each in my possession:

South Islay (Kildalton/Port Ellen):
* Ardbeg 10
* Lagavulin 16
* Laphroaig 10

Northeastern Islay (Port Askaig):
* Bunnahabhain 12
* Caol Ila 12

Northwestern Islay (Port Charlotte):
* Bowmore 10
* Bruichladdich Classic Laddie
* Kilchoman Machir Bay

Seven standards, seven days. That has a nice ring to it. Let's start with something new today.

### Caol Ila 12 years old

The run down:
* [Official website](https://www.malts.com/en-us/our-whisky-collection/caol-ila/caol-ila-12-years-old/)
* Corporate overlord: Diageo
* 43% ABV
* Likely chill filtered and E150 coloring added
* Paid $22.56 for a 200 mL bottle as part of a ~$300 online order shipped from [Fine Drams](http://www.finedrams.com)
* $2.82/25mL pour

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Peat smoke, sea, citrus. Like a tamer Lagavulin
* **Palate**: Light-medium bodied, a bit of sea, smoke and citrus
* **Finish**: Light peat smoke up front, light citrus and then a nice long smoky finish

This is like a slightly subdued, citrusy Lagavulin. I call Lagavulin a delicate dram and this is even more delicate. The smoke is subdued but more than I expected based on reputation. This is really sippable. I like it a lot. I get a slightly unpleasant artificial citrus like flavor after a few sips. I'm curious how this note evolves with oxidation.

Mrs Whisky:

> Ughhhh... I don't know. They all taste gross... yeah, I'm getting some smokiness. But mostly burning. It's like old, dirty fire. Not smoky. More ashy. How do you drink this crap?

Now there's an endorsement! Back tomorrow revisiting Bunnahabhain 12.

Mr. and Mrs. Whisky Bob signing off.

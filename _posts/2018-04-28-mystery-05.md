### Overnight scraps

* **#1**: Woah, that's watery. Not much cherry left on the nose or mouth. Sorry 5 mL of whisky. I have shown you much disrespect.
* **#2**: Smells like Coca Cola now! Some wood or maybe rye spiciness comes to the fore. Some nice lingering sweetness and woodiness on the finish. It's diminished a bit from yesterday but I do get some different interesting notes now. Thank you for holding up, whisky.
* **#3**: Almost nothing on the nose. Not much left on the taste, either. Apologies for the disrespect, whisky.

Whisky Bob signing off.

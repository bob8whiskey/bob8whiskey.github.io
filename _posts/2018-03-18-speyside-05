#### Facts

* 40% ABV
* "Blended Irish whiskey finished in craft Irish Pale Ale-seasoned barrels"
* No age statement
* Paid $1.99/50mL
* $1.00/25mL pour

#### Notes

* Nose: Like regular Jameson with floral sweetness. Bananas. Quite lovely, actually!
* Taste: Light, bananas
* Finish: First like standard Jameson and then the hops hit with dryness and bitterness. I don't like hoppy beer and I don't really like this. The hops subside and the Irish flavor with a bit more banana sweetness lasts awhile. I like the end of the finish.

#### Conclusion:




### Final Thoughts

I went back and forth between the Caskmates and the Redbreast earlier in the day. I started with the Caskmates and then the Redbreast seemed oddly savory. The Caskmates seemed overly sweet when I went back to it.

The Connemara was interesting but didn't quite live up to expectations due to the odd finish. I'm going to give these a few days or so before revisiting to see if they change or I do.

Whiskey Bob signing off.

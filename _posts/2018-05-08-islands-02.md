I'm just going to go up in age for the rest of these samples. I usually like to circle back and try things more than once... I don't have the patience for that so I'm going to drink the full 30 mL sample each day. Onto Tobermory 10 from the Isle of Mull.

### Tobermory 10

The run down:
* Isle of Mull
* 46.3% ABV
* Unchill-filtered
* Paid $6.12 shipped for a 30 mL sample from Fine Drams
* Corporate overlord: Distell
* [Official website](http://tobermorydistillery.com/our-whiskies/tobermory-10-year-old/)

* **Nose:** Light earthy funk and citrus - like a funky Glenlivet or Speyburn
* **Taste:** Some sweetness and funk. Light/medium bodied
* **Finish:** Weird funky peaty, veggie sweetness. The weird hits right away and then fades to the taste of dirty feet. Bitter taste left at the end.

Ugh, I really don't like that finish. It's like all the funk of Tullamore Dew or Speyburn cranked up a few notches. There was an almost rancid quality. I made a twisted face with each sip. I had trouble finishing this 30 mL pour and it got worse as it went along.

What does the website say?

> Delightfully enticing, smooth and velvety, our 10 year old hand-crafted signature unpeated expression is one of outstanding finesse.

Nope. Dirty feet that stepped in rancid trash. **D/D-**.

Busy couple of days taking me away from whisky sampling. Quick final taste of the Macallan Double Cask 12 sampler tonight. Same impressions as before - I like it but prefer the overall smoothness of the standard Macallan 12. A couple more busy days coming up, unfortunately.

Whisky Bob signing off.

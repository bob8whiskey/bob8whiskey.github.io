Smoke is powerful. So powerful that it blasts the 7 day limit off the week timeframe.

I'm still on travel and enjoyed visiting some new liquor stores. I wanted to find an expression like the Ardbeg Uigeadail but more complex. I was ultimately steered towards the Lagavulin Distiller's Edition and picked up a bottle on sale for $99. 

It pours a bit darker than the standard 16. On the nose, I immediately get red wine. This is the winiest whisky I've yet encountered. There's smoke but it's a bit more reserved on the back end.

The finish - immediately sweet wine with the smoke creeping up on the back end. When I breathe through my nose with my mouth closed, I get that winy sweetness. I open my mouth and chew and there's the smoke. The sweet finish stays longer than the smoke. The finish is remarkably like the Johnnie Walker Black... and I also feel like there's a bit too much sweetness on the finish here.

I was hoping to try out some new smoky whiskys while on travel. Unfortunately, the work schedule hasn't been amenable to visiting bars. Fortunately, some Lagavulin 16 and Laphroaig 10 made the trip with me in some [little nippers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GWRC65W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I had a short neat pour of Lagavulin with the sunrise. The whisky cuts through the morning chill and warms your heart. The complexity puts you in a contemplative mood to think about the upcoming day.

I returned long after the sun set to try the Laga16 and Laph10 alongside a burger. The complexities of the Laga16 were lost in the pairing but the more straight forward profile of the Laph10 held up well. It's probably best to save the Laga for soolo enjoyment or lighter flavor pairings.

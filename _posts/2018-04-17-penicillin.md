![There's a cocktail here somewhere]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018-04-17-penicillin.JPG)

Mrs. Whisky's mom is in town so we got out for a date, delaying the completion of Islay standards. I snuck in a bit of Islay behind my [burger](https://www.eater.com/2013/4/17/6448213/anatomy-of-an-icon-the-craigie-on-main-burger) - a penicillin cocktail with blended Scotch and Compass Box Peat Monster. The cocktail was a delicious mix of lemon and ginger with a nice smoky aroma. It was delightful on its own and nicely complemented the burger. This is right in my flavor sweet spot. Mrs. Whisky even liked it! I'll have to make some penicillins at home.

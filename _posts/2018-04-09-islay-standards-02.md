Welcome to day 2 of Islay Standards week. I'm taking on the second You know you're obsessed with Islay when you've memorized the spelling of Bunnahabhain. Scottish actor Brian Cox, can you help us out with the pronunciation of Bunnahabhain?

### Bunnahabhain 12 years old

The run down:
* Northeast Islay - Port Askaig
* 46.3% ABV
* Paid $49.99 for a 750 mL bottle at a New Hampshire liquor outlet
* $1.67/25mL pour
* Corporate overlord: Distell
* [Official website](https://bunnahabhain.com/our-whisky/12-year-old/)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Sweet and nutty. No peat.
* **Palate**: Light bodied, sweet in the mouth. A bit of burn.
* **Finish**: Sweet and nutty finish. Medium length. A bit of a weird bitter note is in there but mostly very pleasant. The finish gets a bit too sweet after too many sips in a row.

This is really good stuff. The sweetness is hitting me more this time than the other times I've had this. It's a bit much to be honest but I really like this. This is sweet and nutty from start to finish. I'll give it a **B** for now, with the sweetness and odd bitter note taking it down a bit.

Mrs Whisky:

> I get some caramel on the nose. Sweet. I like the way it smells. It's not too bad if I sip just a little tiny bit.

That's like an A+ coming from her!

Mr. and Mrs. Whisky Bob signing off.

Long day at work and I wasn't quite up for sampling three mystery whiskies tonight so I whipped up a Manhattan:

* 2 oz Stagg Jr.
* 1 oz Noilly Prat Dry Vermouth
* Few dashes of Angostura Bitters
* Tangelo peel (cause I don't got no oranges)
* 2 Luxardo cherries and juice

Fun fact - a potato peeler works ok to peel a bit of tangelo! Shook the whiskey, vermouth and bitters in a shaker with ice. Drained into a rocks glass. Wiped the glass with the tangelo peel and threw it in. Added the cherries and some juice.

And it's... OK, I guess? I went with the dry vermouth to counteract the sweetness of the Stagg Jr. but it just kind of sucked the delicious flavor out of the Stagg. I don't really like the dry vermouth and wish I would have gone sweet. I could get on board with the sweetness overload. I can really see why one typically makes a Manhattan with a spicier rye that will stand up to the vermouth.

On the plus side, the nose is really nice with the tangelo peel. Luxardo cherries are quite choice and worth the price over the typical grocery store fare. The drink improves a bit if I swirl around in my mouth before swallowing. But I'd definitely take straight up Stagg Jr. over this. **C-**

Back to sampling the mystery whiskies side by side tomorrow!

Time to sum up my first impressions of all the standard Islays. I'm impressed by the large variety of flavors present on this tiny island. I'm also impressed by the quality. All of these are really good drams. Even my least favorite, Bowmore 12, is solid and I knocked it largely for not matching my flavor preferences. Below is a quick summary of all these expressions ranked by my preference. Cost here is from metrowest Boston Total Wine to have uniformity of source.

I'd call Lagavulin 16 my clear favorite, Ardbeg 10 my clear second favorite, and Bowmore 12 my clear least favorite. The rest are really good and could easily change places any given day depending on what I was in the mood for.

I'm up for a couple days of randomness before jumping back into a regular series... not sure I'm ready to dare back to the Canadian samples so might need to find something else first...

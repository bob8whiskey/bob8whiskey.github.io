Time for mystery whisky #2!

### Mystery Whisky #2

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Wood, vanilla, caramel. Not terribly complex but nice. I enjoy it more the longer I sit with the dram.
* **Palate**: Light bodied, a bit of tingling, vanilla sweetness.
* **Finish**: Medium length finish. Lots of wood notes with some cinnamon and vanilla sweetness. A bit of a drying sensation. Very rich.

There's a bit more going on here than in sample #1. I really like the nose and the sweet notes. The wood notes add complexity but I feel like it overpowers the other flavors a bit. **B-/B**.

The vanilla and wood notes give me a bourbon vibe but the overall profile seems more like Scotch. My guess is a 40-something ABV bourbon but wouldn't be surprised if it were from somewhere abroad.

This is fun! Can't wait to try #3 tomorrow!

These Canadian samplers have been a bit tough to get through. To compare with the super sweet flavored whiskies of yesterday, I'm revisiting a favorite today - the delicious sherry bomb that is Aberlour A'bunadh batch #60. I poured a nice $2.33 25mL neat in a Glencairn.

This is definitely a "sweet" Scotch but the sherry flavor is very different from the sugary flavored whiskies. While there's some alcohol burn at 60% ABV, it's far less than the flavored whiskies. The sweetness is very pleasant here. A small sip goes a long way and this is a delicious dram. I'm noticing a trace of waxiness in the finish that I've noticed before - I don't like it and it brings the experience down a bit.

For kicks, I pour in 25 mL of Ardbeg 10 when I'm about halfway through the dram. The straw-colored Ardbeg mixes with the deep copper A'bunadh to form a color somewhere in the Laphroaig/Lagavulin range.

* Nose: Sherry with some smoke hiding underneath. The Ardbeg character is there but it's more of the citrusy/ashy notes than the smoek.
* Taste: Sherry sweet on the tongue and peat smoke in the back of my mouth. This is easier to drink than straight A'bunadh.
* Finish: Sherry first, then Ardbeg smoke then a nice marriage of the two. It reminds me of the Lagavulin Distiller's but with an Ardbeg character. The finish lasts a long while and I get varying notes of sherry and smoke. I like. There's a bit of that unpleasant A'bunadh waxiness but it's reduced.

In conclusion, don't water down your A'bunadh with water. Water it down with Ardbeg!

After a week+ of Islay whiskies, I have the great privilege to start my random grab bag with... another Islay. With reviews ranging between "best Laphroaig ever" to "pointless" I'm crazy curious about [Laphroaig Lore](https://www.laphroaig.com/product/lore/). I found a bottle for the amazingly low price of $64.99 in a ritzy Boston suburb of all places (it seems to usually go for $100+). Let's see how this first pour goes...

### Laphroaig Lore

The run down:
* South Islay - Kildalton/Port Ellen
* 48% ABV
* Non chill-filtered
* Paid $65 for a 750 mL bottle
* $2.17/25mL pour
* [Official website](https://www.laphroaig.com/product/lore/)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Smells like Laphroaig... maybe some extra sweetness. Vanilla/caramel comes after a time.
* **Palate**: Hotter Laphroaig, sherry sweet notes. Nice oily texture. Some tingling. Quite a lot going on in the mouth. More caramel the more I drink it.
* **Finish**: Smoky, woody, sweet. Medium finish with the smoke and sweet notes lasting a bit longer.

This is an interesting one... pretty, pretty interesting... I'm not entirely sure what to make of it yet. There's some characteristic Laphroaig character but then sherry, wood and caramel sweet notes at varying times. I think I quite like this but need a bit more time with it to fully understand it. It reminds me a lot of the Lagavulin Distiller's Edition with different flavors coming at different times. Will be curious to see this one evolve.

Back with something random tomorrow.

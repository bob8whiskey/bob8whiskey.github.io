Yesterday's Bulleit Rye reminded me the most of Redbreast 12 and that would have been a logical dram to try today... but I've been craving a Japanese expression and my heart wins out. I picked up this bottle of Suntory Toki up in December before I started this whisky quest. I grabbed it because I freaked out about spending $65 on a bottle of Lagavulin. February Whisk(e)y Bob, sitting on a $700 whisk(e)y stockpile, laughs at December Bob's innocence.

#### Facts:

* The [website](https://www.suntorytokitime.com/home) is marketing junk and facts are hard to find
* 40% ABV
* Paid $33 for a 750 mL bottle
* Intended more as a mixer

#### Tasting:

* Nose: Noticeable alcohol burn. Light and fruity underneath.
* Taste: Very light. Some light citrus fruity notes. An interesting earthy tobacco note that becomes more noticeable as I drink.
* Finish: Short. Some lingering fruit notes. More of that earthy tobacco when chewing.

In some ways, this reminds me of Glenfiddich and Glenlivet, only with that tobacco note, which makes it far more interesting. This one seems to have a bit more going on. It's very light and pleasant. I didn't like it neat back in December but a couple months of near daily drinking will change your perspective.

So I have about 50 mL of each mystery whisky left. I'm going to go through a series of blind tests and slowly roll out the grand reveal today.

### Blind test intro

Mrs. Whisky is graciously pouring blind serves for me. I'm looking for the following notes in my tasting:

* **#1**: Cherry!
* **#2**: Woody, vanilla sweetness
* **#3**: Speyside-like character

### Test #1: Blind Smell Test

The cherry note made #1 easy to distinguish. One of them was a bit sweeter and the other a bit woodier and I correctly called them out as #2 and #3 respectively. Hey, I went 3/3!

### Test #2: Blind Taste Test




Whisky Bob signing off.

It was a fun week of random whiskies. I'm going to take today off and then revisit the Kildalton trio and Speyside for some "official" reviews. In other news, I had a fun time talking whisky late last week with an old group of friends. It's so fun to see how everyone has different tastes and favorites. Looking forward to tasting with them in person in the not so distant future.

NoWhisky Bob signing off.

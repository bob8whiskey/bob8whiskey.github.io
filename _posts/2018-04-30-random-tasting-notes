My first drams of Lagavulin 8 and 12

<!--more-->

### Lagavulin 8

This is 48% ABV

* **Nose:** Surprisingly light on the nose. Lighter smoke than expected, floral, citrus,
* **Taste:** There's the smoke! Tingly in the mouth. Oily. Coating. Lots of flavor.
* **Finish:** Yum, that's pure strong Lagavulin character right away on the finish. There's a nice combination of medicinal and citrus notes that last quite awhile. Very long finish. Lemony bandaids. Mmmmmmm... It's just a really nice

Well hot damn! This is really yummy. This lacks the complexity of the 16 but makes up for it in pure flavor.

### Lagavulin 12

58% ABV

* **Nose:** Very similar to the 8. A bit hotter. Minerally and peaty.
* **Taste:** Lots of tingling. More minerally than smoky. Sweet and salty on the tongue
* **Finish:** Lots of peat flavor here. It just goes on and on. There's some characteristic Lagavulin but it hits like Uigeadail. Lighter flavors come out on the finish. Lots of layers of flavors.

This one is really good. Really, really good. I'm thinking straight A.

I poured a healthy $1.33 25mL neat pour of Laphroaig 10 in a Glencairn. I appreciate this stuff more and more. Peat smoke is the main note but there's a beautiful seaweed, brine-like note that is the characteristic Laphroaig note. It's less intense than the Ardbeg but more than the Lagavulin. There's a bit of saltiness that comes along. I could only taste the smoke when I first tried this years ago. I wonder if it's spending more time with this particular expression or drinking more whisky that's opened up my appreciation.

### Mrs. Whisky's Take

While I ponder my own experience, let's check in with Mrs. Whisky on Laphroaig. Her first exposure is after I've had a sip.

> You are wafting smoke!

OK... but how do you like it?

> So smoky. Like licking an ash tray. Not as bad as yesterday.

> **_Grade:_** **C**. I wouldn't drink it but can see how someone would. It's not gross, I just don't like it.

Mr and Mrs. Whisky Bob signing off.

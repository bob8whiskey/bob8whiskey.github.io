Time to wrap up this sampling of Ireland.

### Tullamore D.E.W.

This was by far my least favorite the first time around. It tasted like feet. I'll be trying it solo first and then later on alongside Redbreast 12.

* Nose: There's an unpleasant earthiness at first that gives way to the Irish "buttery" notes with a nice extra dose of honey. The earthiness grows on me as I sit with this dram. I still find it unpleasant but can just as easily see someone else calling it out as a favorite note.
* Taste: Better than the other day. Less earth than before. More honey, some ginger. Not a ton going on.
* Finish: Fairly short. A little alcohol burn. Some citrusy honey flavors linger. Not bad.

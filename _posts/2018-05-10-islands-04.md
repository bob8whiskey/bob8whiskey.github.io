It's my last day of new whiskey from the Scottish Islands. I've been looking forward to this one - Arran 18 years old. This might be the oldest age statement I've yet tried.

### Arran 18

The run down:
* Isle of Arran
* 46% ABV
* Looks like no color added
* Paid $9.40 shipped for a 30 mL sample from Fine Drams
* Corporate overlord: Independent, bay-bay!

* **Nose:** Caramel, sherry, malt
* **Taste:** Light-medium bodied. Sweet in the mouth
* **Finish:** Initial sweet kick followed by more malty notes.

This is very pleasant but a tad boring. It reminds me of the Speyside Glens but is a bit more interesting. Probably not worth the price of a full bottle but I'm glad I tried it. **B-/B**.

Back tomorrow with some concluding thoughts on the Islands.

Whisky Bob signing off.

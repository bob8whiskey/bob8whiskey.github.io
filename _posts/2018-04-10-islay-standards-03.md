Islay Standards Day 3 and we move to the Loch Indaal area in the northwest of the island. First up is the Bruichladdich distillery with their standard Classic Laddie Scottish Barley expression. Bruichladdich offers a wide range of flavors and the Classic Laddie is unpeated.

Bruichladdich prides themselves on transparency and provide recipe codes for each bottle, even the 200 mL small bottle I have. My recipe code is 17/144 and I see that it contains a variety of casks aged between 7 and 11 years. Bourbon, PX sherry and other casks were used. They even record where the barley was grown. Pretty cool!

Let's give it a taste.

### Bruichladdich Classic Laddie Scottish Barley

The run down:
* Northwest Islay - Loch Indaal
* 50% ABV ("F yeah!" - ed)
* Un-chill filtered and colouring-free
* Paid ~$20 for a 200 mL bottle as part of $60 [Wee Laddie Gift Pack](https://www.bruichladdich.com/bruichladdich/wee-laddie-gift-pack) at a New Hampshire liquor outlet
* $2.50/25mL pour
* Corporate overlord: RÃ©my Cointreau
* [Official website](https://www.bruichladdich.com/bruichladdich/the-classic-laddie)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: There's an awful lot going on here. Sherry mixed with the sea. Something like tobacco or leather. Pepper. Citrus.
* **Palate**: Light-medium bodied, sherry sweetness, tingling.
* **Finish**: All the above flavors come out at different times. Medium length finish. I'm left with a sensation of lemon pepper jerky. There's a sense of sea here as well. Peppery sea.

This is really unique and it'll take some more time to gain a true appreciation. My best comparison is a mix of the smoothness and nutty-sherry notes of Bunnahabhain 12 mixed with the earthy funk of Speyburn 10 mixed with the sea flavors of Laphroaig. I really like this and give it a **B+** first impression grade.

I'm really excited to try the rest of the Bruichladdich range. The Wee Laddie sampler also included 200 mL bottles of their Classic Laddie with Islay-grown barley and their peated Port Charlotte expression. I'm really excited about the Port Charlotte as some peat would really take this over the top... hmmm... there's a Bruichladdich-Ardbeg frankenwhisky in my future...

Unfortunately, it was a late night and Mrs. Whisky was asleep before having a chance to be revolted by this. She'll have plenty of chances to try it soon enough.

Back tomorrow with Bowmore 12.

Whisky Bob signing off.

Let's power through these Speysides. Back to boringtown with Glenlivet 12...

#### Glenlivet 12 - 15 mL

I'm glad I drank this separately from the Glenfiddich. I can appreciate them more on their own. This has a bit more alcohol burn than I remember. Otherwise, it's fairly light and drinkable. A bit of apple juice and malt. Still a bit boring for my tastes but I can see how folks like this. *C* because it's solid but its profile bores me.

Mrs. Whisky:

> At first I thought I liked it and then it burned. It tastes burny and then dirty.

#### Macallan 12 Double Cask - 15 mL

This is as I remember it - a bit oakier version of Macallan 12. While I usually like a bit of extra flavor/funk, the standard Macallan 12 is so good at what it does that this is a step down. *B-*

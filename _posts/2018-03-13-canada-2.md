![Canadian Samplers]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2018-03-12-canada.jpg)

I was planning to come back to Speyside today but got bored thinking about Glenlivet. So I'm going to drink Canadian whisky instead!

At some point I decided to pick up any sampler I could find for a reasonable price. There's some standard Canadian expressions in here and some stuff that looks like rubbish. I look forward to trying them all! Up today are neat ~15 mL pours of Crown Royal standard and Reserve. As normal for my first time trying new expressions, I'm just sniffing and drinking without any further research today.

### Canadian Club

#### Facts:

* 40% ABV
* Blended Canadian whisky
* No age statement
* Paid $4.39/50mL
* $1.32/15mL pour

#### Notes:

* Nose: Big alcohol hit.
* Taste: A lot of sweetness in the mouth. Alcohol.
* Finish: Lingering bitter sweetness lasts awhile.

#### Conclusion:


### Pendleton

#### Facts:

* 40% ABV
* Blended Canadian whisky
* No age statement
* Paid $5.99/50mL
* $1.80/15mL pour

#### Notes:

* Nose: Even more alcohol!
* Taste: Similar body and flavor profile as the standard.
* Finish: A bit of toffee or caramel up front with more spice and that "cheap whisky" flavor on the back end. There's a lingering bitterness that's not altogether pleasant. I get more of that pine/hops flavor after a couple sips.

#### Conclusion:

This might be a bit higher tier of whisky with the toffee-like finish but I think I prefer the standard. I'm not a hoppy guy and the nose puts me off a bit.

### Final Thoughts

Neither one of these did a whole lot for me but they're easy drinking and at least have a little flavor. These could both work as mixers or even sippers. I prefer the profile of the cheaper "Fine De Luxe" but it really leaves me craving a bourbon or rye with more intense flavors.

I needed to have the right circumstances (no screaming children) and be in the right mindset (not exhausted from chasing the screaming children) to revisit old Lagavulin 16. How does my first love stack up after branching out?

### Lagavulin 16

The run down:
* South Islay - Kildalton/Port Ellen
* 43% ABV
* Chill-filtered and E150 coloring added - I thought this looked so classy at first. Knowing it's fake takes a lot away.
* Paid $65 for a 750 mL bottle
* $2.17/25mL pour
* Corporate overlord: Diageo
* [Official website](https://www.malts.com/en-gb/our-whisky-collection/lagavulin/lagavulin-16-years-old/)

Tasting notes:
* **Nose**: Peat smoke, sea, earthy, medicinal (more like bandaids than Laphroaig). Very similar nose to Laphroaig 10.
* **Palate**: Oily texture, smoky, woody and medicine notes on the tongue.
* **Finish**: Long and smoky with sweet notes. Characteristic Lagavulin medicinal bandaid notes that I love. Dry and complex. Nice to sit with. It's a delicate smoke that rises and falls as you breathe through your mouth.

Well, this tastes like my whisky home. Smoky but delicate. Complex finish. Bandaid notes that drive me wild. I only wish it had natural coloring and were a bit stronger. **A-**. The 8 and 12 year old Lagavulins are on the short list for a vertical tasting if I can find them for a good price.

Back tomorrow with a summary of the standard Islays and maybe a special tasting if I have time for a stop...

Whisky Bob signing off.

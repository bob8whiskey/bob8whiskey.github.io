Crazy week, so just a quick drink of my old favorite A'bunadh tonight. Good stuff. Had a swirl of Laphroaig 10 at the end of the dram and it was quite nice. A bit more seaside flavor than mixing with Ardbeg. I think I prefer the Ardbeg for the raw power but this was good, too.

Whisky Bob signing off.

I think I'm coming down with something. I was feeling pretty sick today and wasn't up for a real tasting so again revisited some A'bunadh. This time with a side of Nyquil. You really double down on the syruppy texture when you do it this way. You also get a nice doubling of the sinus clearing effects. 5/5 would double down again.

Whisky Bob signing off.

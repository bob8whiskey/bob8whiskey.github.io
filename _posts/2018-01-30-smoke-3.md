Comparing two standard Islays today. I come into this with a preference for the complexity of the Lagavulin 16 over the Laphroaig 10. My wallet really wants me to develop more of a tast for the Laphroaig. I'm curious to read through the distillers' notes before diving into my tastings to see if that has any impact.

### Laphroaig 10 ($0.80 for my 15 mL pour from a $40 750 mL bottle)

Notes from the [Laphroaig website](https://www.laphroaig.com/product/laphroaig-10-year-old/):
* Colour: Full sparkling gold
* Body: Full bodied
* Finish: Lingering
* Nose: Huge smoke, seaweedy, "medicinal", with a hint of sweetness.
* Palate: Surprising sweetness with hints of salt and layers of peatiness.

More peatiness on the nose.

Meaty body. Straight forward finish - semi drying, peaty smokiness

### Lagavulin 16 ($1.30 for my 15 mL pour from a $65 750 mL bottle)

Notes from the [Lagavulin website](https://www.malts.com/en-us/our-whisky-collection/lagavulin/lagavulin-16-years-old/):
* Region: A roaring bonfire from the coast of Islay.
* Appearance: Deep amber gold.
* Nose: Intensely flavoured, peat smoke with iodine and seaweed and a rich, deep sweetness.
* Body: Full, rich bodied.
* Palate: Dry peat smoke fills the palate with a gentle but strong sweetness, followed by sea and salt with touches of wood.
* Finish: A long, elegant peat-filled finish with lots of salt and seaweed.

More sweetness on the nose along with the peat.

Whiskey Bob is traveling to

JW Black, Nose: Some sweetness, generic alcohol, generic sweetness. Very pleasant sweet finish.

https://www.johnniewalker.com/en-us/our-whisky/johnnie-walker-labels/black-label/

Johnnie Walker Black Label is rich, complex and incredibly well-balanced, full of dark fruits, sweet vanilla and signature smokiness.

Blended exclusively from whiskies matured for at least 12 years, it brings together flavors from the four corners of Scotland to create an experience that is complex, deep and rewarding. Johnnie Walker Black Label rolls decadently over the tongue, releasing intense sweet vanillas that give way to orange zest and aromas of spice and raisins. The finish is unbelievably smooth and layered with rich smoke, peat and malt.

Mouth feel - a bit light, want something a bit heavier.

Nice sweetness and vanilla and oakiness when chewing. Swallowing reveals more fruit like flavors. Long finish. There's a warmth there but I don't get a lot of smokiness. But it's very pleasant. Light vanilla & wood & sweetness. Very pleasant.

I was honestly looking forward to crapping on this whisky but it's really quite lovely. I'd prefer something with a bit more body and a bit more depth of flavor but this tastes quite nice. It's quite sippable.

Spiciness and sweetness on the nose. I don't know if I've just been living in Islay too long but I'm not getting much smoke out of this at all. It's giving me much more of a Speyside profile.

I finally start detecting some smoke a few sips in now that I'm looking for it... there's definitely some peat there but much more subdued than the ArdLaphLas of the world. I read somewhere that there's some more Caol Ila in here. I really need to try the Caol Ila on its own to start detecting its profile.

There it is now... a light peat smoke on the back end but it's almost hidden compared to the vanilla/sweet woody notes. mmm... this is good stuff. I feel like I should be shitting on this but I can't.

There's almost too much sweetness on the back end here. Next sniff adn I get waaaayyy more sweetness

C (70-79): Some good stuff, some bad stuff

Aberlour A'Bunadh box

Matured exclusively in Spanish Oloroso sherry butts

A'bunadh, Gaelic for "of the origin" is matured exclusively in Oloroso sherry butts. It is a natural cask strength malt whisky produced without the use of modern chill-filtering methods or the addition of water.

As Aberlour a'bunadh is released in small batches, the flavours may vary slightly from one bottling to another.

Colour: Deep, rich amber.
Nose: Aromas of mixed spices, praline and spiced orange harmonising with rich, deep notes of Oloroso sherry
Palate: Orange, black cherries, dried fruit and ginger spiked with dark bitter chocolate and enriched with sherry and oak. Full bodied and creamy.
Finish: Robust and intense with bitter-sweet notes of exotic spices, dark chocolate and oak.

Add a dash of water to Aberlour a'bunadh to release all the aromas and bring the whisky to an ideal drinking strength. A light haze may appear in the whisky; this is due to the traditional production methods and does not affect its taste or quality.

### Cragganmore 12 years old - 200 mL Box

#### Side

An elegant, sophisticated Speyside with the most complex aroma of any malt

Astonishingly fragrant with sweetish notes and a smoky maltiness on the finish

#### Back

Cragganmore, founded by the legendary John Smith in 1869, is for many the definitive Speyside malt. For malt whisky writer Michael Jackson, it has "the most complex aroma of any malt... astonishingly fresh and delicate."

Back in the 1920s this was voted the finest of all Scottish Malt Distillers' malts by their blenders, being titledA1" for blending.

On tasting it, it's not hard to see what those blenders saw. Mature and well balanced, with an astonishingly fragrant aroma, the slight fruitiness on the palate is overlaid with sweet, smoky notes with hints of sandalwood.

A long finish packed with hints of smoky sweetness brings this delightful, refined experience - so accessible, yet so rewarding, gently to a close.

Complexity married to such refinemenet is not easily found. This is truly a Classic Malt - still the leadign Speyside that John Smith set out to create.

Cragganmore is teh distinguished Speyside destination on a journey around Scotland's six malt whisky making regions. the other Classic Malts are:

*Glenkinchie* Lowland
*Dalwhinnie* Highland
*Talisker* Skye
*Oban* West Highland
*Lagavulin* Islay

No whisky for the next couple days as I work on reviews of the Kildalton trio... and figure out how to make an index page for reviews in jekyll! I love the code nerdiness of this platform but it's also a bit of a pain in the ass to do simple things. But there's a great sense of accomplishment when you figure out how to pull it off.

NoWhisky Bob signing off.
